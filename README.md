To create a service application that depends on three other services to function properly. In this case for this project created a service app that generates a random number and random letter and joins the two together to generate a random sentence (dare) in service3 pushing this feature on to the main service (service4).

## Project Brief
To create a service application that depends on three other services to function properly. In this case for this project created a service app that generates a random number and random letter and joins the two together to generate a random sentence (dare) in service3 pushing this feature on to the main service (service4).
The project name: Darephase - through its development it was designed to allow users to have access to a mini-game. The idea itself was generated from house games with friends and family and designed for fun. This project was built on docker container images and it runs on python langauage as the majority.

## Risk Assessment
Before this project started I used trello to plan out on the direction of the project and also kept all logs updated whether it was errors and fixes made within the application itself. I also had to carry out extensive research on some topics i didn't quite understand in-order to meet the requirements of the services. Generated a few ideas from the start and started looking at the ones that were potentially approachable based on the topics covered during my training weeks. I also started doing a risk assessment of the project as i started building the application.

The app itself is running on the MVP but however it is currently using 4 images (services) in order for it to function to its purpose. The app has been tested whilst being developed for example some services connections and outputs, Postman was used to check if each service was giving out the right output.

## Delievered Solution

To produce this solution i had to use tools that go hand to hand with each stage of the development stage. The solution is based on flask-app service with 3 services working with the frontend which is service4 in this case.
